# External Resources

While Prometheus is busy stealing fire from Mount Olympus, we strongly encourage you to familiarise yourselves with the following excellent websites and courses that exist already: you may find something in here that speaks to you as a student or teaches you something you didn't know.

At present these resources are purely Ethereum/EVM oriented: we will expand this to include platforms such as StarkNet, Solana et al going forward.

### Information & Guidance

- **[Pentacle](https://pentacle.xyz/)**: Who can you trust in a trustless world? Crypto is an adventure, full of opportunity but also rife with scams, information overload, and confusing jargon. Pentacle is your lantern through the dark forest, the talisman of protection on your crypto quest, providing verified information, safe links and helpful learning tools.
- **[DevPill.Me](https://devpill.me/)**: A public good blockchain development guide aimed at becoming the go-to learning resource aggregator for building on Ethereum and its wider ecosystem of scaling solutions and applications.
- **[Useweb3](https://www.useweb3.xyz/)**: A platform for developers to explore and learn about Web3, whether you're a new dev getting your hands dirty for the first time, or a seasoned developer making the transition into the Web3 space.

### Introductory Tools & Courses

- **[CryptoZombies](https://cryptozombies.io/)**: An interactive school that teaches you all things technical about blockchains. Learn to make smart contracts in Solidity by making your own crypto-collectibles game. **Highly** recommended as a first step on your Solidity journey.
- **[Ethernaut](https://ethernaut.openzeppelin.com/)**: A Web3/Solidity based wargame inspired on overthewire.org, played in the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM). Each level is a smart contract that needs to be 'hacked'.
- **[Eth.Build](https://eth.build/)**: A drag-and-drop, open-source sandbox environment for visually understanding _how_ Ethereum works.
- **[ApeAcademy](https://academy.apeworx.io/)**: a project-based learning platform for building in Web3 using Ape Framework - high-quality videos and in-depth articles on using Ape Framework for Vyper smart contract development.

### Bootcamps & Finishing Schools

- **[Secureum](https://www.secureum.xyz/epoch0)**: A 3-month long intense bootcamp meant primarily for participants who want to get into smart contract security auditing as a part/full time profession.
- **[Macro](https://0xmacro.com/engineering-fellowship)**: Learn Solidity security and best practices from engineers who have worked on & audited billion-dollar crypto protocols.
- **[Artemis](https://www.artemis.education)**: A comprehensive 8 week bootcamp that covers everything from fundamentals to dApp development for Web3 students, designed by Web3 veterans.

### Core References

- **[Ethereum Development Documentation](https://ethereum.org/en/developers/docs/)**: Documentation designed to help you build with Ethereum. It covers Ethereum as a concept, explains the Ethereum tech stack, and documents advanced topics for more complex applications and use cases.
- **[Ethereum White Paper](https://ethereum.org/en/whitepaper/)**: Summary of the EVM, accompanied by some additional context.
- **[Ethereum Yellow Paper](https://ethereum.github.io/yellowpaper/paper.pdf)**: Formal specification of the EVM.
- **[EVM.Codes](https://evm.codes/)**: An interactive reference to EVM opcodes.
